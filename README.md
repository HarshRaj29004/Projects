# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project!

## Instructions

Before running the `main.py` script, please follow these steps:

1. **Complete the Data Preparation**

   This Jupyter notebook is designed to perform essential data preprocessing and preparation tasks. Ensure you run all cells in this notebook to generate the necessary files and data required for the main application.

   **Steps:**
   - Execute each cell in this notebook sequentially.
   - Make sure that the notebook completes without errors and that the required output files (such as `similar.pkl`) are generated.

2. **Run the Main Application**

   After completing the notebook, you can run the main script `main.py` to start the movie recommendation system. Ensure that all generated files are available in the expected directories.

   ```bash
   python main.py
